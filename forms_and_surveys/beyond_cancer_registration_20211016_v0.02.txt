[[Block:COVID-19 Screening]]


[[Question:DB]]
Regardless of your vaccination status, have you experienced any of the symptoms in the list below in the past 48 hours? IMPORTANT: ANSWER “YES” EVEN IF YOU BELIEVE THE SYMPTOM(S) IS BECAUSE OF SOME OTHER MEDICAL CONDITION (FOR EXAMPLE, ANSWER “YES” IF YOU HAVE A RUNNY NOSE BECAUSE OF ALLERGIES).
- fever or chills
- cough
- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
- fatigue
- muscle or body aches
- headache
- new loss of taste or smell
- sore throat
- congestion or runny nose
- nausea or vomiting
- diarrhea
If you have had any of the above symptoms in the last 48 hours, DO NOT physically return to the workplace until symptoms have been improving for more than 48 hours. If you have a medical condition that causes any of these symptoms and you need access to a CDC facility within the next few days, you will need a waiver from CDC’s Occupational Health Clinic (OHC). To begin the waiver process, please contact your CIO management officer and ask them to request a waiver on your behalf through OHC. When OHC contacts you, please be ready to email medical documentation supporting your waiver request to clinicinfo@cdc.gov. Waivers will only be granted in exigent circumstances and only if it is safe to do so. OHC will not respond to waiver requests made by individuals. Fully vaccinated individuals with symptoms will also require a waiver.
